If you are modifying it in the Arduino IDE, it will need to be opened in V1 of the software, V2 does not yet play nice for my liking.
It will also need to be left in the containing folder or the Arduino IDE will not open it.

If you are using any other IDE, I have no idea how to get you on the right path.
